                <h2>Excel Financial Budget Dashboard (2025)</h2>
                <p class="typing-text">Followed a guided tutorial by "The Office Lab" to build visualizations, automated formulas, and two personal modeling systems inside Excel. My main goal was creating something practical—a tool I could actually use to budget income and expenses, track my net worth, and monitor transactions between my accounts and stocks. Through this project, I learned the basics of Excel and Excel-based financial modeling. Having this budget has helped me make better financial decisions when it comes to expenses, and I've cut down on a lot of unnecessary wants.</p>

                <h2>Personal Portfolio Website (2025)</h2>
                <p class="typing-text">Built my own website from scratch for a multitude of reasons: I wanted a digital portfolio to showcase my personal projects—ranging from coding/programming, writing, or other artistic forms of expression; I wanted to relearn HTML/CSS/JavaScript before I embarked on working with Python and C++; I don't find LinkedIn appealing for showcasing my experience.<br></br><br>My goal with this project was to create a minimal, professional website to call my own. I planned to have 'cool' colors and to have an actual interactive timeline but sometimes "little goes a long way." And I was ultimately inspired by a Stanford scientist's personal website and a 20-minute tutorial that I saw on YouTube. This project has allowed me to learn about UI design, web development and engage with the fundamentals of HTML/CSS/JavaScript that I haven't used since freshman year of high school. And to grasp the higher/harder concepts of these languages, I used online and Ai resources.</br></p>
