            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Nathaniel, a Biomedical Engineering student at Boston University. I'm driven by my curiosity for the teleology and ontology of the natural world and a belief that truth comes from seeing the whole. I'm currently studying engineering with interests in biomedical designs for both neuro and nanotechnology. Outside of academics, I work on personal technical builds, write fiction and analyses, and explore creative projects that connect the abstract to the physical.</p>

                <summary>What I Value</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understanding first</strong> — I start every project by learning how things work, whether it's engineering, biology, or building a believable fictional world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> — I look at the bigger picture, find connections, experiment, iterate, and refine complex ideas into simple, functional solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity & awe</strong> — I chase those “gotcha” moments that expand what I know and keep learning meaningful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helping others</strong> — Work feels most fulfilling when it benefits someone and makes a real impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quiet focus & flow</strong> — I do my best work in calm, independent environments where I can follow questions naturally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose over polish</strong> — Usability and intention matter more to me than aesthetics for their own sake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work ethic</strong> — I value punctuality, discipline, and perseverance, even while still learning resilience.</li>
                </ul>

                <summary>My Approach</summary>
                <p><strong>I</strong> start every project with research — understanding the landscape, language, and purpose before anything else. There’s a lot I don’t know yet, and learning the fundamentals gives my exploration direction. Uncertainty still unnerves me, but I treat it as the starting point of inquiry; turning the unknown into something clearer is part of the work, even when some questions remain open.<br><strong>I</strong> rely on structured learning because it gives me a foundation I can bend later. Once I understand the rules, I can experiment, warp them, or build something entirely new. My pace shifts with the problem: I move quickly when I recognize patterns, and slow down when depth matters. When things break, I cycle through frustration, reflection, and rebuilding — a process that’s uncomfortable but consistently transformative.<br><strong>My</strong> workflow adapts to the medium. Coding pushes me to iterate, test, and revise, while math or art allows for more linear focus. Still, nothing ever feels truly finished. I revisit projects long after they’re “done,” always finding new angles or possibilities.</p>

                <summary>Personal Note</summary>
                <p>I enjoy building things, understanding why they work, and expressing ideas through writing and art. I like calm spaces, long-form thinking, and projects that let me combine multiple perspectives. This site is a place where I bring those threads together.</p>
